This project can follow and analyze the windows event log. 

In the Event Log, both the application log and the system log contain errors, warnings, and informational events that are related to the operation of Exchange Server, and other applications. To identify the cause of message flow issues, carefully review the data that is contained in the application log and system log.
In this project, we are intered in Security Logs. We used that site to follow event log id. Event Id means: A Windows identification number that specifies the event type.

Before the specify event id you should decide what you need. You can analyze the "An account was successfully logged on" or "Special privileges assigned to new logon".. etc.
